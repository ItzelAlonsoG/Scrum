**12 Agile principles**

1. Customer satisfaction: Delivering value to the customer.

2. Changes: Changes are welcome. The faster the changes are accepted.

3. Functional software: Software that can be used by the client and in short periods of time.

4. Collaboration: How you interact and communicate with the client.

5. Motivated individuals: Give a good environment, independence and authority to make their own decisions.

6. Face-to-face communication: Most efficient method, be with the client and read their body language.

7. Progress: Running software is the main measure of progress.

8. Sustainable development: The development throughout the process is constant in each of the iterations.

9. Continuous improvement: As they are iterative, you can see that it was done well and that it can be improved for the next iteration.

10. Simplicity: Prioritize and do the work that is well defined at that precise moment.

11. Self-organization: That the team is capable of making its own decisions.

12. Self-evaluation: That the team is able to adjust and perfect its behavior to improve.

**3. Scrum Artifacts**

Scrum artifacts represent work or value in various ways that are useful in providing transparency and opportunity for inspection and adaptation.
They are those elements that define what the client wants, but are visible to all the people who work on the project.<p/>

a) Product list (Product Backlog). It is an ordered list of everything that is known to be necessary in the product.<p/>
b) Sprint Backlog. Items from the product list selected for the sprint.<p/>
